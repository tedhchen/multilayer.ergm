\description{
An undirected network of militarized interstate disputes between two countries. This network data is adapted from Zeev Maoz's (2005) dyadic MID data set. The network includes 189 states in the international system during the post-Cold War period (1989-1995) except Samoa. The row and column names are country codes from the Correlates of War project.
